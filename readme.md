# HeroBot App

[**HeroBot**](https://herobot.site) is your personal AI learning wizard that guides you through the adventurous journey of acquiring new skills. It crafts personalized roadmaps based on your existing knowledge and familiarity with a subject, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. As your loyal sidekick, HeroBot helps you stay on track with your learning goals, communicating through instant messaging platforms e.g., Telegram. To learn more about the hows (e.g., How does HeroBot help you learn more efficiently?) and whys (e.g., Why do you need yet-another learning tool?), please visit our [about](https://herobot.site/about) page.
